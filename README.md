# SVDReconstruction

Matlab program to deconstruct a jpeg and then reconstruct a rank n approximation of the image. Uses singular value decomposition in order to create the approximation.

Also the program prints what percent of the original image's Frobenius norm is captured by the approximation

Also included: a practice image
